# DataJoint Core C FFI
The **DataJoint Core C FFI** is a C foreign function interface (FFI) that exposes features and functionalities implemented in the [DataJoint Core Library](../datajoint-core) over C headers. Any high-level programming language that has interoperablity with the C programming language can use this C FFI to integrate DataJoint Core features into a project.
